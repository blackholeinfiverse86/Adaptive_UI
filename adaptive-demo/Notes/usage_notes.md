# When to Use Each Pattern

## Focus Assist Pattern
**Use it when:**
- People keep hitting undo (classic confusion sign)
- Complex interfaces with lots of options
- First-time users who look lost
- Critical decision points

**Skip it when:**
- Simple interfaces (overkill)
- Expert users moving fast
- Gaming contexts (different mindset)
- Mobile interfaces (touch is different)

## Hover Relief Pattern
**Use it when:**
- Users need to compare options
- Decision-heavy interfaces
- Shopping/selection scenarios
- Dense layouts with lots of info

**Skip it when:**
- Fast workflows (gets in the way)
- Touch-only devices (no hover)
- Simple yes/no choices
- Time-sensitive tasks

## Attention Re-centering Pattern
**Use it when:**
- Reading-heavy interfaces
- Learning content
- Long-form interactions
- Focus matters for success

**Skip it when:**
- Quick task completion
- Browsing/scanning behavior wanted
- Multi-tasking environments
- Interactive games

## Navigation Guide Pattern
**Use it when:**
- Complex navigation structures
- Multi-level menus
- Workflow processes
- Users frequently get lost

**Skip it when:**
- Simple linear flows
- Single-page apps
- Expert user tools
- Minimal design requirements

## What Works Well
- Learning management systems
- Business applications
- Complex configuration tools
- Multi-step processes

## What Doesn't
- Games and entertainment
- Social media feeds
- Simple utility apps
- Mobile-first designs
- Real-time collaboration

## My Implementation Tips
1. Start with just one pattern (seriously)
2. Test with actual users (not your team)
3. Adjust timing for your specific audience
4. Keep animations subtle (less is more)
5. Always test accessibility
6. Watch task completion rates

## Mistakes I've Made
1. Tried too many patterns at once (chaos)
2. Made animations too flashy (annoying)
3. Ignored mobile users (bad idea)
4. Assumed instead of testing (wrong assumptions)
5. Forgot about accessibility (not cool)
