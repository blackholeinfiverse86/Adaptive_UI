# Why I Built This

## The Problem I Noticed
Users get frustrated with interfaces. I've watched people hover over the same button five times because they can't decide. Or hit undo repeatedly when they're confused about what to do next. Traditional interfaces just sit there doing nothing while people struggle.

## My Solution
I built a system that watches how people interact and helps when it detects confusion. Instead of waiting for someone to ask for help, the interface jumps in with subtle visual guidance.

## The Key Insight
**Actions tell you more than clicks.**

When someone hovers multiple times, they're hesitating. When they undo repeatedly, they're confused. When they navigate back and forth, they're lost. These patterns are signals I can respond to.

## What Makes This Different
- **Not annoying**: No popups or interruptions, just gentle visual changes
- **Not overwhelming**: One thing at a time, with smart prioritization
- **Not intrusive**: Works with existing interfaces, fails gracefully

## My Philosophy
**"When in doubt, do nothing."**

I'd rather miss helping someone than annoy them. Every change has to pass safety checks first.

## Where This Works Best
**Good for:**
- Complex dashboards
- Multi-step workflows  
- Learning platforms
- First-time user experiences

**Skip it for:**
- Simple interfaces
- Fast-paced games
- Real-time collaboration tools

## How It Works Technically

### What I Watch For
- **Undo loops**: Confusion signals
- **Hover repeats**: Indecision patterns
- **Navigation backtracking**: Lost behavior
- **Dwell time**: Deep focus moments

### How I Respond
- **Focus Assist**: Highlight the main action
- **Hover Relief**: Fade distractions
- **Navigation Guide**: Show directional hints
- **Attention Re-centering**: Reinforce current focus

### Safety Rules I Follow
- Maximum duration limits (nothing permanent)
- Throttling (no spam)
- Priority system (most important help first)
- Fail-safe error handling

## Success Metrics
I know it's working when:
- People complete tasks faster
- Fewer users abandon workflows
- Support requests go down
- User satisfaction improves
